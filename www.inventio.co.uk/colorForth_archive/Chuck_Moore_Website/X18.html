<h1>Architecture</h1>
The X18 is an evolution of the F21 and i21 microprocessors. With .18um
transistors, it has 5x their speed and 1/5 their power. It has their
16-deep Return and Data stacks and 27 0-operand instructions, packed 3
per word. A 100ms watchdog timer assures continued operation. Boots
from on-chip ROM.
<p>Redesigned with new layout and simulation tools to be robust and to
minimize power. The computer can be throttled by a factor of 1024 to
provide 2.4 Mips using 20 uW. It may be stopped altogether, but will
have to reboot.
</p><p>Multiply (125 Mops) and divide (40 Mops) have been improved.
Internal memory is fast enough (1 ns) to sustain 2400 Mips. Data
access, especially to external SRAM, will slow this. Code is loaded
into on-chip DRAM for execution.
</p><h1> CPU </h1>Forth code is highly factored into many small
subroutines. An optimized processor requires an efficient call/return
mechanism. This is best achieved with 2 push-down stacks. Each is
implemented as a register feeding a 16x18-bit RAM with 8-transistor bit
cells. The current entry is indicated by a 16-bit bidirectional,
circular shift register.
<p>One stack is used to store subroutine return addresses. All
processors have such a stack. The other is used to pass parameters to
and from subroutines. Other processors use registers or stack frames
for this purpose. However, all languages use an implicit stack to
evaluate expressions. Forth makes it explicit.
</p><p> As if emphasizing their importance, the stacks require 2/3 of
the CPU silicon area. It is difficult to achieve their 1-cycle accesss
timing.
</p><p> The merits of stack vs. register designs have been argued for decades. A comprehensive book, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ekoopman/stack_computers/index.html"><em>Stack Computers,</em></a>
by Phil Koopman has been published online. To quote Sec 6.2: "0-operand
stack addressing ... makes stack machines superior to conventional
machines in the areas of program size, processor complexity, system
complexity, processor performance, and consistency of program
execution."
</p><p> The Forth ALU operates on the top 1 or 2 items of the
parameter stack, leaving the result there. This permits 0-operand
instructions. Eliminating register addresses permits shorter
instructions, in this case 5-bit. Several instructions are required to
rearrange the stack. And it's convenient to move things to the return
stack.
</p><p> An address register is useful to reduce stack manipulation. It
also supports incrementing to address successive words in memory.
Similar use of the top of the return stack provides 2 addresses for
memory-memory moves.
</p><p> A demultiplexor allows the packing of up to 3 instructions per
word. This increases the density of compiled code and reduces the
interference between instruction and data memory access. It keeps the
CPU busy while the next instruction is being fetched. Providing a
sustained execution speed of 2400 Mips.
</p><p> This is implemented by a 3-bit shift register. The current bit
enables its slot into the instruction latch. A ready pulse from the
memory manager latches the high-order 5 bits (slot 0). The pulse is
delayed by a string of 14 inverters so that it repeats 2 ns later,
latching the next slot. Slot 2 stops the process, as does a jump or
fetch/store, until the next ready pulse.
</p><p> There are 27 simple instructions, exactly suited to Forth.
This allows 1-1 compilation of Forth source to machine code. On other
processors, each Forth primitive requires several instructions. The
situation is reversed for other languages: several Forth instructions
may be required for their primitives.

</p><p> Another advantage of the 5-bit instruction is ease of decoding.
A tree of NAND and NOR gates lead from the instruction bus to the
enable for each register. This is facilitated by the limit of 10 lines
to be routed: each bit and its complement.
