<h1>Download</h1>
You can download <font color="red">color</font><font color="green">Forth</font> [originally] thanks to UltraTechnology.<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.inventio.co.uk/colorForth_archive/Chuck_Moore_Website/..\Chuck_Moore\COLOR.COM">COLOR.COM Jul31</a>
</li><li><a href="https://www.inventio.co.uk/colorForth_archive/Chuck_Moore_Website/..\Chuck_Moore\BOOT.ASM">boot.asm, floppy source</a>
</li><li><a href="https://www.inventio.co.uk/colorForth_archive/Chuck_Moore_Website/..\Chuck_Moore\GEN.ASM">gen.asm, generic graphics source</a>
</li><li><a href="https://www.inventio.co.uk/colorForth_archive/Chuck_Moore_Website/..\Chuck_Moore\COLOR.ASM">color.asm, kernel source</a></li></ul>
This is the exact version I'm using, limited only in the amount of
source code provided. It's a 63KB .COM program. You're welcome to use
it as you please. But it's a powerful tool, so <font color="red">please be careful.</font>

<p>Current version has these improvements:</p><ul>
<li>A new floppy driver:<ul>
   <li>Does not use DMA, which cannot cross a 64K boundary.
   </li><li>Uses implied seek, which restricts it to newer controllers.
   </li><li>Uses Terry Loveall's e1 strobe, which seems to ease bus timing. Geof Bishop counted only 2/100 successful boots without it.</li></ul>
</li><li>PCI graphics address<ul>
   <li>Search for device class 3
   </li><li>Search for prefetchable memory space</li></ul>
</li><li>Bulletproof look-back optimization<ul>
   <li>Pointer to last optimizable instruction
   </li><li>Tail recursion, ; changes call to jump
   </li><li>Literals<ul>
      <li>@, !, +! with literal address
      </li><li>!, +! literal to literal address
      </li><li>+, or, and with literal</li></ul>
   </li><li>When one macro ends with 'drop' and the next starts with 'dup' both may be eliminated
   </li><li>Optimization is blocked by red word, then, begin (for) which imply a jump destination</li></ul>
</li><li>Icons start at block 12, source at block 18.
</li><li>Words from kernel to source: +, or, and, nip, reads, writes, save
</li><li>PNG screen dump, documentation soon</li></ul>

<p>This version runs on a PC with: 32MB RAM, PCI or AGP graphics, VESA
117 display (1024x768, rgb 565). A floppy is needed for anything but a
demo. There may be graphics it won't run with. And floppies it doesn't
like.
</p><p>You must start <font color="red">COLOR</font>.COM under DOS. It
is an operating system, and takes over the computer. You can then write
a bootable floppy. Alternatively, Unix can copy <font color="red">COLOR</font>.COM to a bootable floppy with cp or dd.

</p><h1>Disclaimer</h1>
This is a reliable program.<ul>
<li>I've used it for years
</li><li>It does not access the hard drive
</li><li>It has no backdoors
</li><li>It does nothing unless you tell it to
</li><li>But don't risk more than you can afford to lose</li></ul>

<h1>By downloading, you agree that

<p><font color="red">I am not responsible for the consequences</font></p></h1>

<ul>
<li>Keep backups!<ul>
   <li>Keep a stack of at least 7 floppies (they're cheap)
   </li><li>Start each day with 'save' to the oldest</li></ul>
</li><li>Undebugged code can and will crash</li></ul>

<h1>First time</h1><ul>
<li>Run <font color="red">COLOR</font>.COM
</li><li>Screen shows logo with keypad at lower right.
</li><li>Mount a formatted floppy. Contents irrelevant.
</li><li>Type 'save ' to write 162 blocks. This floppy cannot be read by DOS, no directory.</li></ul>

<h1>Thereafter</h1><ul>
<li>Power-up, reset or restart computer with <font color="red">color</font><font color="green">Forth</font> floppy mounted (BIOS set for bootable floppy)
</li><li>Screen shows logo. 162 blocks available.</li></ul>

<h1>Platforms</h1>
I've gotten feedback from a number of people. <font color="red">Color</font><font color="green">Forth</font>
runs on some platforms and doesn't run on others. I haven't discerned
any pattern. You pretty much have to download and try it on yours.
<p>I'd like to recommend a current desktop PC that can run <font color="red">color</font><font color="green">Forth</font>
as a dedicated platform. It should have a low price, minimal memory and
no software. Gateway? Dell? Likewise a laptop. Any candidates?
</p><h1>How <font color="red">color</font><font color="green">Forth</font> boots</h1><ul>
<li>Boot sector loaded into low memory at 7c00
</li><li>Turn off interrupts
</li><li>Call BIOS to set graphics mode: 1024x768, rgb: 565
</li><li>Copy itself (1 sector) to location 0
</li><li>Establish 32-bit address space <font color="red">WITH NO PROTECTION!</font> All segment registers are 0, forget them.
</li><li>Read 9 cylinders (162 blocks) from floppy starting at 0
</li><li>Locate frame buffer<ul>
   <li>Look at AGP device: bus 1, device 0, function 0
   </li><li>Use an address in registers 9-5 if it's prefetchable
   </li><li>Otherwise use the one in 4
   </li><li>Comments?</li></ul>
</li><li>Start background task building frames at 3e80000 (top of 32MB RAM).
</li><li>Read block 24 to compile compiler
</li><li>Await keystroke</li></ul>

<h1>How COLOR.COM works</h1><ul>
<li>Loaded into a segment in low memory, .COM programs are limited to 65,280 bytes (63 blocks)
</li><li>Turn off interrupts
</li><li>Call BIOS to set graphics mode. Only BIOS call.
</li><li>Copy itself (63 blocks) to location 0
</li><li>As above</li></ul>
